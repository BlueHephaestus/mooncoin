Import the phase data, create all the other entries, save it to our lookup file.



We need, for every day:
    - Moon phase #, which we can use to convert to:
    - - name of moon phase, e.g. "Waning Crescent"
    - - emoji
    - - image, etc.

0 â€“ new moon
0-0.25 â€“ waxing crescent
0.25 â€“ first quarter
0.25-0.5 â€“ waxing gibbous
0.5 â€“ full moon
0.5-0.75 â€“ waning gibbous
0.75 â€“ last quarter
0.75 -1 â€“ waning crescent

For each day:
file: 0.png, 0.45.png, etc.
desc: "New Moon ðŸŒ‘" etc.

We convert their number to an image we can reference in the imgs folder.
